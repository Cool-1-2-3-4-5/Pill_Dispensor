First Major Arduino Project.
My grandparents need their medicine but I didn't want to have the struggle of asking them what kit what pill is in or haw many of each to have.
As such I created this pill dispenser to store enough pills for more than 3 days worth. Furthermore, one the pills run out, I can add new ones.
There is a manual mode and a pre selected mode.
In the manual mode, the user has to select the number of pills they want.
The pre-selected mode has a set selected and the user only has to press one button to receive the pills.
For this project I used various button 1k ohm resistors, a potentiometer, on LCD, two servo motors, a handful of wires and some cardboard and tinfoil.
For the future I want to add a cover for the top so the pills aren't exposed to air and light.
